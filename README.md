# The-Geet-Project
On this project our final goal will be to implement a distributed system controlled by voice and armed with several widgets, which will help us to learn more about some sensors and actuators and how to use them. It may look quite an ambitious project, but our main objective is to learn by practice.
The inspiration on the voice controlled system is based on the AI system named "JARVIS" and its derivates of the sci-fi universe of Marvel Comics. As said before, it is really ambitious, but our goal is far from it. It's just to implement a pseudo-intelligent system with low capacities that will help us more like a playground project.
Once the project be pseudo-functional, our next goal will be to make it distributed and portable, so you can take it with you everywhere (with less functions) and it can also communicate not only with other distributed components, but with other "Geets".
We cannot promise to make it, but we will try our best!
Thanks for the reading!
